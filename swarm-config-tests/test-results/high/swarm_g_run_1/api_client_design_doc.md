# Rate-Limited API Client Design Document

## Architecture Overview

The RateLimitedAPIClient implements a production-ready HTTP client with advanced features for handling rate limits, retries, and failures in distributed systems.

### Core Components

1. **Rate Limiter (Token Bucket Algorithm)**
   - Configurable requests per time window
   - Non-blocking async implementation
   - Request queuing when limit reached

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - States: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
   - Opens after 5 consecutive failures
   - Automatic recovery with exponential backoff

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Configurable max retries
   - Different strategies for different error types

4. **Metrics Collection**
   - Request count, success/failure rates
   - Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Circuit breaker state transitions
   - Rate limit hits

5. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors (connection, timeout)
   - HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx)
   - Rate limit errors (429)
   - Circuit breaker errors

### Design Decisions

1. **Asyncio for Concurrency**: Chosen for efficient I/O handling and natural integration with modern Python web frameworks.

2. **Token Bucket over Sliding Window**: Provides smoother rate limiting and better burst handling.

3. **Decorator Pattern for Metrics**: Clean separation of concerns and easy testing.

4. **Type Hints Throughout**: Better IDE support and runtime validation with tools like mypy.

5. **Structured Logging**: JSON format for easy parsing in log aggregation systems.

### Security Considerations

- TLS/SSL verification by default
- Configurable timeout to prevent DoS
- No credential logging
- Request/response sanitization in logs

### Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling via aiohttp
- Request deduplication for identical concurrent requests
- Lazy initialization of expensive objects
- Memory-efficient request queue with max size limit
