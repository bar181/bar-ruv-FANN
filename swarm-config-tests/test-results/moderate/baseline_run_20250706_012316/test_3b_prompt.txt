Implement a Python class for 2D matrix operations without using NumPy:

```python
class Matrix:
    """2D Matrix with basic operations"""
    
    def __init__(self, data):
        # Initialize from 2D list
        pass
    
    def transpose(self):
        # Return transposed matrix
        pass
    
    def multiply(self, other):
        # Matrix multiplication (self @ other)
        pass
    
    def determinant(self):
        # Calculate determinant (for square matrices)
        pass
    
    def is_invertible(self):
        # Check if matrix can be inverted
        pass
```

Requirements:
1. Implement ALL methods with proper error handling
2. Support matrix multiplication with dimension checking
3. Calculate determinant using recursive cofactor expansion
4. Include comprehensive tests covering edge cases
5. Add clear docstrings with examples

Provide complete implementation with usage examples.
