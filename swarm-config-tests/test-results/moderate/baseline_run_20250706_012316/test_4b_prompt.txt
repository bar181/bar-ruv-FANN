Research and compare these database technologies for a high-traffic e-commerce platform:

1. PostgreSQL with read replicas
2. MongoDB with sharding
3. DynamoDB
4. CockroachDB

Analyze each for:
- Performance characteristics (read/write throughput)
- Scalability patterns and limitations
- Consistency guarantees and CAP theorem tradeoffs
- Operational complexity and costs
- Best use cases within e-commerce (catalog, orders, inventory, user data)

Provide:
1. Detailed comparison table
2. Architecture recommendations for different e-commerce components
3. Migration considerations from traditional RDBMS
4. Sample configuration snippets for optimal performance

Make a specific recommendation with justification.
