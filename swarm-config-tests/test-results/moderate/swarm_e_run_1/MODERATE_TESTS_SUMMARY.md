# Moderate Tests Summary - Team 1
## 8-Agent Dual Team Swarm Configuration (Swarm E)

### Test Configuration
- **Team**: Team 1 (Moderate Tests)
- **Swarm Type**: 8-agent dual team configuration
- **Total Agents**: 8 (split between 2 teams)
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-06

### Test Results Overview

#### Test 1b: Code Generation - TaskQueue Class
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Full thread-safe priority queue with heapq
- **Features Delivered**:
  - All required methods (add_task, get_next_task, peek, is_empty)
  - Thread-safe implementation with threading.Lock
  - Priority levels (HIGH=1, MEDIUM=2, LOW=3)
  - FIFO ordering within same priority
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - 7 unit tests including thread safety test
  - Usage examples and design documentation
- **Test Results**: All tests passed, thread safety verified

#### Test 2b: Debugging - Race Condition Fix
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Bugs Fixed**:
  1. Race condition in increment() - Fixed with proper lock usage
  2. Non-thread-safe read - Added lock to get_count()
  3. Not waiting for threads - Added proper join() calls
  4. No thread cleanup - Ensured all threads are joined
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added reset() method with thread safety
  - Comprehensive testing showing bug vs fixed behavior
  - Stress test with 10 threads × 1000 increments passed
- **Results**: Original code lost 3997 updates, fixed code maintains perfect count

#### Test 3b: Mathematical Problem - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Solution**: Multiple shortest paths found, all 40 minutes
  - A → C → E (15 + 25 = 40)
  - A → B → C → E (10 + 5 + 25 = 40)
  - A → B → C → D → E (10 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 40)
  - A → C → D → E (15 + 10 + 15 = 40)
- **Implementation**:
  - Full Dijkstra's algorithm with heap-based priority queue
  - Handles disconnected graphs gracefully
  - Time complexity: O((V + E) log V)
  - Extended feature for finding near-optimal paths
  - Comprehensive test suite with edge cases
- **Performance**: Large graph test (100 nodes) completed in 0.11ms

#### Test 4b: Research & Analysis - Caching Strategy
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Recommendation**: Redis as primary caching solution
- **Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive feature comparison matrix
  - Architecture diagram with Redis cluster design
  - Specific caching strategies for each data type
  - Complete implementation code for cart caching
  - 5-phase migration plan over 10 weeks
  - Detailed cost-benefit analysis showing $2.8-3.5M NPV
- **Key Insights**:
  - Hybrid approach using Redis + application-level caching
  - Different TTL strategies for different data types
  - Write-through pattern for shopping carts
  - Cache-aside for real-time inventory
