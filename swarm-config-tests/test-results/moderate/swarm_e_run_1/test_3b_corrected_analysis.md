# Corrected Analysis for Test 3b

## Path Analysis Correction

After running the algorithm, I found that there are actually multiple shortest paths from A to E, all with a distance of 40 minutes:

1. **A → C → E**: 15 + 25 = 40 minutes
2. **A → B → C → E**: 10 + 5 + 25 = 40 minutes  
3. **A → B → C → D → E**: 10 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 40 minutes
4. **A → C → D → E**: 15 + 10 + 15 = 40 minutes

All these paths are equally optimal at 40 minutes. The algorithm correctly found one of them (A → C → E).

## Key Insights

1. **Multiple Optimal Paths**: This network has several paths with the same optimal distance, which is common in real-world networks.

2. **Algorithm Correctness**: Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find one of the shortest paths. The specific path returned depends on the order of node processing.

3. **Near-Optimal Paths**: Since all paths found were exactly 40 minutes, there were no paths within 10% that weren't already optimal. The next shortest path would need to be ≤ 44 minutes to qualify.

4. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently explored the graph and found all paths within the threshold using a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and depth-first search.
