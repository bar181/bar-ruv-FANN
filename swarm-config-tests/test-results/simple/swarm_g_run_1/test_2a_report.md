# Test 2a: Debugging - Fix Factorial Function
## Engineering Team Report

**Test Duration:** 1 minute
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Bug Analysis
The Engineering Team quickly identified and fixed two critical bugs:

1. **Bug 1: Incorrect Initialization**
   - **Found by:** Backend Developer
   - **Issue:** `result = 0` 
   - **Problem:** 0 multiplied by any number equals 0
   - **Fix:** Changed to `result = 1` (multiplicative identity)
   
2. **Bug 2: Off-by-one Error**
   - **Found by:** Full-Stack Developer
   - **Issue:** `range(1, n)`
   - **Problem:** Excludes n from the multiplication
   - **Fix:** Changed to `range(1, n+1)`

### Implementation Details
- Clear bug explanation with examples
- Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases
- Edge case handling for negative numbers
- Special case explanation for factorial(0)

### Test Results
