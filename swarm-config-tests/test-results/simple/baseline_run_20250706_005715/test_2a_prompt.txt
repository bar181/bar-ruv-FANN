Debug and fix the following Python function that should calculate the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial of n (n!)"""
    if n < 0:
        return "Error: Negative number"
    
    result = 0  # Bug 1: Should be 1
    for i in range(1, n):  # Bug 2: Should be range(1, n+1)
        result *= i
    
    return result

# Test cases that are failing:
assert factorial(0) == 1  # Returns 0
assert factorial(5) == 120  # Returns 0
assert factorial(1) == 1  # Returns 0
```

Requirements:
1. Identify and fix all bugs
2. Explain what was wrong
3. Add 2-3 more test cases
4. Ensure the function handles edge cases properly
