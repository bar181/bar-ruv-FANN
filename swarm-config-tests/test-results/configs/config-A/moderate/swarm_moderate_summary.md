## Test Results

### Test 1b: TaskQueue Implementation ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Create thread-safe priority queue class
**Key Features Implemented:**
- Thread-safe priority queue using heapq and threading.Lock
- Three priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) with FIFO within same priority
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Type hints and detailed docstrings
- 7 comprehensive unit tests including thread safety validation
- Additional utility methods (size, clear, priority stats)

**Technical Excellence:**
- O(log n) operations for add/get using heapq
- Proper task wrapper class with timestamp for FIFO ordering
- Production-ready thread safety with consistent locking
- Extensive edge case handling and validation

### Test 2b: API Authentication Debug ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Debug and fix API authentication code
**Bugs Identified and Fixed:**
1. **Timestamp Inconsistency:** Different timestamps between token generation and headers
2. **Ineffective Caching:** Cache was useless due to constantly changing timestamps
3. **Incorrect Signature Format:** Wrong order in signature string construction
4. **Missing Secret Integration:** Secret not properly included in signature

**Corrected Implementation:**
- Consistent timestamp usage across token and headers
- Proper signature format: sha256(api_key + endpoint + sorted_params + timestamp + secret)
- Intelligent caching with 5-minute window validation
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Cache cleanup and statistics for debugging

### Test 3b: Matrix Operations ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Implement 2D matrix class without NumPy
**Complete Implementation:**
- Matrix creation from 2D lists with validation
- Transpose operation (rows ↔ columns)
- Matrix multiplication with dimension checking
- Determinant calculation using recursive cofactor expansion
- Invertibility checking (square + non-zero determinant)
- Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases

**Mathematical Correctness:**
- Proper matrix multiplication algorithm (O(n³))
- Recursive determinant calculation (mathematically sound)
- Accurate invertibility determination
- Support for floating-point precision handling
- Additional utility methods (copy, shape, element access)

### Test 4b: Database Technology Analysis ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Compare database technologies for e-commerce platform
**Comprehensive Analysis Completed:**
- **Four technologies analyzed:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CockroachDB
- **Performance characteristics:** Read/write throughput, latency, scaling patterns
- **CAP theorem implications:** Consistency vs availability tradeoffs
- **Operational complexity:** Setup, maintenance, monitoring, costs
- **E-commerce specific use cases:** Orders, catalog, inventory, analytics

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- **Hybrid approach:** PostgreSQL (primary) + DynamoDB (high-scale components)
- **Architecture by component:** Detailed recommendations for each e-commerce subsystem
- **Migration strategy:** Phased approach from traditional RDBMS
- **Configuration samples:** Optimized settings for each technology
