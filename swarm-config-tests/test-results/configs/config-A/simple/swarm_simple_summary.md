## Test Results

### Test 1a: Merge Sorted Lists ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Create Python function to merge two sorted lists
**Key Features Implemented:**
- Type hints and comprehensive docstring
- Edge case handling (None inputs, empty lists)
- Efficient two-pointer merge algorithm (O(n+m))
- Type validation with proper error messages
- 6 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios

**Code Quality:**
- Full type annotations using typing module
- Defensive programming (input validation)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation with examples

### Test 2a: Debug Factorial Function ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Debug and fix broken factorial function
**Bugs Identified and Fixed:**
1. **Multiplicative Identity Error:** Changed `result = 0` to `result = 1`
2. **Range Boundary Error:** Changed `range(1, n)` to `range(1, n+1)`
3. **Edge Case Handling:** Added explicit handling for factorial(0) = 1

**Additional Improvements:**
- Provided both iterative and recursive implementations
- Added comprehensive test suite beyond original failing cases
- Performance comparison between implementations
- Better error handling and documentation

### Test 3a: Fence Optimization ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Solve calculus optimization problem with implementation
**Mathematical Solution:**
- Constraint: 2w + l = 100 (3-sided fence)
- Objective: Maximize Area = w × l
- Optimal solution: w = 25m, l = 50m, Area = 1250m²
- Proved optimality using calculus (derivatives)

**Implementation Features:**
- Complete mathematical proof with calculus
- Python function with input validation
- Visualization capability with matplotlib
- Comprehensive test suite verifying mathematical correctness
- General solution for any fence length

### Test 4a: Framework Comparison ✅
**Duration:** Completed
**Task:** Compare Python async frameworks for REST API
**Analysis Completed:**
- **FastAPI vs Aiohttp vs Sanic** comprehensive comparison
- Evaluated: ease of use, performance, features, community support
- **Recommendation:** FastAPI for the given requirements
- Provided working code examples for all three frameworks
- Performance benchmarks and dependency analysis

**Key Insights:**
- FastAPI best for moderate Python experience + auto documentation
- Aiohttp for minimal dependencies + manual control
- Sanic for Flask migrants without documentation needs
