# Comprehensive Landing Page Creation Test Prompt

Create a professional-grade, single-page HTML landing page that showcases the capabilities of your specific agent configuration. This test evaluates research, design, implementation, and quality assurance capabilities across different swarm configurations.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Research Phase (Required)
- Research the ruvnet/ruv-FANN repository to understand ruv-swarm's capabilities, architecture, and benefits
- Research top 2025 website landing page design trends, color schemes, and interactive patterns
- Research free, high-quality image sources (Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay) for professional visuals
- Research modern Tailwind CSS components and glassmorphism/neumorphism effects

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Single HTML file**: `[agent_name].html` (e.g., baseline.html, 5-agent-swarm.html)
- **Framework**: HTML5 with Tailwind CSS (CDN) and custom CSS
- **No placeholders**: Every button, link, and interactive element must be functional
- **Interactivity**: All clickable elements must trigger toast notifications or modal dialogs
- **Performance**: Optimized loading, minimal external dependencies, efficient CSS

### 3. Content Requirements

- **Configuration Display**: Prominently feature your agent configuration details:
  - Number of agents
  - Topology type (mesh, hierarchical, ring, star)
  - Strategy (balanced, specialized, adaptive)
  - Special capabilities of your configuration
- **ruv-swarm Section**: Detailed explanation of ruv-swarm technology based on research
- **Agentic Engineering Section**: Professional explanation of agentic engineering principles
- **Creation Process**: Section explaining how your specific configuration created this page
- **Performance Metrics**: Display your configuration's performance characteristics

### 4. Design Requirements
- **2025 Design Trends**: Implement at least 3 modern design trends from research
- **Color Scheme**: Research-based modern color palette with WCAG AA compliance
- **Typography**: Professional font hierarchy with modern typefaces
- **Images/Graphics**: Minimum 3 high-quality images from free sources (properly attributed)
- **Animations**: Subtle micro-interactions and scroll animations
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices

### 5. Interactive Elements (All Functional)
- **Navigation**: Smooth scroll to sections with active state indicators
- **CTA Buttons**: Modal with configuration details
- **Feature Cards**: Toast notifications with additional information
- **Contact Form**: Modal dialog with form validation
- **Social Links**: Toast notifications with "Following" confirmation
- **Performance Toggle**: Show/hide performance metrics dynamically

### 6. Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant colors and structure
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags, semantic HTML, structured data
- **Performance**: Page load under 3 seconds, optimized images
- **Cross-browser**: Test compatibility statement in footer
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing resources
