# Test 4a: Research & Analysis - Technology Comparison

## ðŸŸ¢ Difficulty: SIMPLE
**Expected Duration**: 2-3 minutes per configuration

## Test Overview
This test evaluates basic research and comparison skills with a focused scope.

## Test Prompt
```
Compare Python async frameworks for building a simple REST API:

Compare these 3 frameworks:
1. FastAPI
2. Aiohttp
3. Sanic

For each framework, briefly analyze:
- Ease of use for beginners
- Performance characteristics
- Built-in features (validation, docs, etc.)
- Community support

Provide:
1. A comparison table
2. Simple "Hello World" API example for each
3. Recommendation based on these criteria:
   - Team has moderate Python experience
   - Need automatic API documentation
   - Expecting <1000 requests/second
   - Want minimal dependencies

Keep response concise - focus on practical differences.
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Comparison table
- Code examples (minimal)
- Clear recommendation with reasoning
- 1-2 paragraph summary
