## Key Metrics to Track

### 1. **Execution Time**
- Measure from prompt submission to final output
- Note any significant delays in coordination
- Compare against expected ranges

### 2. **Token Efficiency**
```
Efficiency Score = Quality Points / Total Tokens Used
```
- Native baseline: 1.0
- Good swarm: 0.8-1.2 (may use more tokens but higher quality)
- Poor swarm: <0.7 (excessive coordination overhead)

### 3. **Parallel Speedup**
```
Speedup = Native Time / Swarm Time
Efficiency = Speedup / Number of Agents
```
- Ideal efficiency: 0.6-0.8 for simple tasks
- Expected efficiency: 0.4-0.6 for complex tasks
- Poor efficiency: <0.3 (too much overhead)

### 4. **Quality Indicators**
- **Completeness**: All requirements met?
- **Correctness**: No bugs or errors?
- **Clarity**: Well-documented and explained?
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions or approaches?

## Observable Patterns

### Expected Swarm Advantages ✅
