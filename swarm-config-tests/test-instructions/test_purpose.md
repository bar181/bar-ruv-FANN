**structured plan to compare Claude (native) vs different Swarm configurations** across **agent count and swarm architecture**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Objective**

Measure performance and behavior differences between:

1. **Claude Native** (baseline)
2. **Swarm Configs**:

   * Varying number of agents (1, 3, 5, 10, etc.)
   * Different architectures:

     * **Flat**: all agents respond in parallel
     * **Hierarchical**: one coordinator agent delegates to sub-agents
     * **Dynamic**: agents coordinate based on task (e.g. work-stealing, weighted voting)

### üß™ Test Matrix

| Mode           | Agent Count | Architecture | Purpose                    |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Claude Native  | 1           | ‚Äî            | Baseline (no swarm)        |
| Swarm Config A | 3           | Flat         | Simple parallel responses  |
| Swarm Config B | 3           | Hierarchical | One lead, others support   |
| Swarm Config C | 5           | Dynamic      | Adaptive task coordination |
| Swarm Config D | 10          | Flat         | Stress test parallel swarm |

More can be added as needed.

### üîç Evaluation Metrics

Measure on each task type (e.g. coding, math, research):

| Metric                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy/Correctness** | Do they reach the correct answer?                 |
| **Coherence**            | Are answers logically structured and consistent?  |
| **Latency**              | Time from task prompt to final output             |
| **Token Efficiency**     | Tokens used vs value delivered                    |
| **Consensus Divergence** | In multi-agent mode, how much do agents disagree? |

### üß† Task Types

Each test run should apply the matrix above across tasks:

1. **Coding**: Generate or debug code
2. **Math**: Solve symbolic or numeric problems
3. **Research**: Summarize, compare, or generate insights

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Implementation Steps

1. **Define Task Prompts** for each type (e.g. ‚ÄúWrite a Python function for‚Ä¶‚Äù)

2. **Automate Testing**:

   * Use Claude API directly (native)
   * Use your `ruv-swarm` MCP to send the same task to:

     * 1 agent
     * 3 agents (flat/hierarchical)
     * 5+ agents (dynamic coordination)

3. **Log Output**:

   * Total time
   * Token usage
   * Final answer
   * Agent messages (optional for qualitative analysis)

4. **Score and Compare**:

   * Manual or automated scoring (could include hallucination detection or correctness tests)
