- [ ] Thread-safety properly implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Good test coverage (5-7 tests)
- [ ] Clean code with type hints
- Quality Score: ___/10

### Test 2b - API Debugging:
- [ ] Found timestamp mismatch bug
- [ ] Found signature format issue
- [ ] Found caching logic problems
- [ ] Provided complete fix
- [ ] Clear explanation of issues
- Quality Score: ___/10

### Test 3b - Matrix Operations:

- [ ] Proper dimension checking
- [ ] Determinant calculation works
- [ ] Good error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive tests
- Quality Score: ___/10

### Test 4b - Database Research:
- [ ] Thorough comparison of all 4 databases
- [ ] Specific e-commerce considerations
- [ ] Clear architecture recommendations
- [ ] Practical configuration examples
- [ ] Well-justified recommendation
- Quality Score: ___/10

## Overall Assessment
- **Average Quality Score**: ___/10
- **Total Tokens Used**: ___ (check Claude interface)
- **Key Strengths**: 
- **Areas for Improvement**: 

## Notes for Swarm Comparison
These MODERATE tests are more complex than SIMPLE tests:
- More interdependent components
- Require deeper analysis
- Better suited for multi-agent collaboration
- Thread-safety and debugging benefit from multiple perspectives
