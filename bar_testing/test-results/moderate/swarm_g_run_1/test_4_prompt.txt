Analyze and recommend a caching strategy for an e-commerce platform:

Context:
- 50,000 daily active users
- Product catalog: 100,000 items
- User sessions with shopping carts
- Personalized recommendations
- Real-time inventory updates
- Global presence (3 regions)

Compare these caching solutions:
1. Redis
2. Memcached
3. Hazelcast
4. Application-level caching (in-memory)

Analyze each for:
- Performance at scale
- Data persistence options
- Clustering/replication capabilities
- Cost implications
- Implementation complexity
- Specific e-commerce features support

Deliverables:
1. Feature comparison matrix
2. Architecture diagram for recommended solution
3. Caching strategy for different data types:
   - Product catalog
   - User sessions
   - Shopping carts
   - Recommendations
4. Implementation code snippet for cart caching
5. Migration plan from current no-cache setup

Consider: Some data needs persistence, some is ephemeral,
and inventory must be real-time accurate.
