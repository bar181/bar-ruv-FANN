# Test 3a: Mathematical Problem - Fence Optimization
## Engineering Team Report

**Test Duration:** 1.5 minutes
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Team Approach
- **Backend Developer**: Implemented core optimization algorithm
- **Full-Stack Developer**: Created visualization component
- **DevOps Engineer**: Developed comprehensive test suite
- **Engineering Lead**: Verified mathematical proof and coordinated delivery

### Mathematical Solution
**Problem:** Maximize rectangular area with 100m fence against a wall

**Solution Process:**
1. Set up constraint equation: 2w + l = 100
2. Express area as function of width: A(w) = w(100-2w)
3. Find critical point: dA/dw = 0 → w = 25m
4. Verify maximum: d²A/dw² = -4 < 0 ✓

**Optimal Dimensions:**
- Width: 25m
- Length: 50m  
- Maximum Area: 1250m²

### Implementation Features
- Clean function with input validation
