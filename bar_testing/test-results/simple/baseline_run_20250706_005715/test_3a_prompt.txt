Solve the following optimization problem:

A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to create a rectangular enclosure 
against a straight wall (so only 3 sides need fencing).

1. Find the dimensions that maximize the enclosed area
2. Prove your answer is optimal using calculus
3. Implement a Python function that:
   - Takes fence_length as input
   - Returns optimal dimensions (width, length) and maximum area
   - Validates inputs (positive fence length)
4. Create a simple visualization showing the area vs. width relationship

Example: maximize_enclosure(100) â†’ (width=25, length=50, area=1250)
