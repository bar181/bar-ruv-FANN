Test 1a: Merge sorted lists
Create a Python function called 'merge_sorted_lists' that:

1. Takes two sorted lists of integers as input
2. Returns a single sorted list containing all elements from both lists
3. Handles edge cases (empty lists, None values)
4. Includes type hints and a docstring
5. Write 3-5 unit tests for the function

Example:
merge_sorted_lists([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]) â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
